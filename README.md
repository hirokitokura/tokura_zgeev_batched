# A GPU Implementation of Bulk Computation of the Eigenvalue Problem for Many Small Non-Hermitian matrices
We provide the CUDA-program for bulk computation of the eigenvalue problem for many small real non-hermitian matrices in the GPU.

Our program supports eigenvalue computation of COMPLEX matrices of which size is equal or less than 64. 
The size of all metrices should be the same.
